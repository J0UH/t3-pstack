# CONTEXT - domain glossary

Names for the concepts this repo's design discussions keep reaching for. Architecture reviews use these terms; if a review needs a concept that isn't here, add it.

- **Host** - the harness a T3 thread runs on and that loads the plugin: Claude Code (`.claude-plugin/`) or Codex (`.codex-plugin/`). Both read the same `plugins/pstack/` tree. The skill text names each host's own form inline where the two differ, such as a skills directory or a question tool.
- **T3 form** - upstream's skill text with every Cursor mechanism rewritten into what T3 provides: `delegate_task` children and persona briefs read by path, `schedule_task`, `watch_pull_request`, `t3_thread_*` reads, and sheet entries for models. It lives in the text itself, so a skill needs no second file to run on T3.
- **Agent Skill** - one directory under `plugins/pstack/skills/` with portable `name` and `description` frontmatter. Upstream marks every pstack and thermos skill but `setup-pstack` `disable-model-invocation: true`, and the six cursor-team-kit skills carry no flag. The port drops the flag from `poteto-mode` alone, so the session-start hook can invoke it, and `poteto-mode` opens the others by path.
- **Model sheet** - `t3-pstack-models.md` in the host's config directory, one role per line, each value a T3 entry (`<providerInstanceId>/<modelId>` plus `<optionId>=<value>` pairs) or `inherit-parent`. `setup-pstack` writes it and `t3-sheet.mjs` checks it against `orchestrator_capabilities`.
- **Model policy** - the role defaults in `plugins/pstack/models.json`, as tiers of T3 entries. The generator stamps them into each skill's Models section, interrogate's reviewer table, and setup-pstack's sheet block.
- **Role** - a named unit of delegated work with its own model choice (`arena runners`, `how explorer`, `swarm workers`). The role vocabulary lives in `models.json`.
- **Panel** - a role whose value is a list (`arena runners`, `architect runners`, `interrogate reviewers`, `arena cross-judge pool`). A panel spans at least two model families; a family is the first segment of a model ID's last `/` part.
- **Substitution** - a rule in `tools/substitutions.json` that rewrites one upstream sentence or token into its T3 form. An anchored insert is a substitution that keeps the upstream sentence and appends T3 text.
- **Fork** - a file the port keeps in its own form, declared in `tools/forks.json` with its reason. Every upstream change to it needs a person.
- **Port-only file** - a file under a component's local path that upstream does not carry, such as the manifests, the hooks, `models.json`, and `settle.ts`.
- **Sync boundary** - the split between what upstream owns (the skill text) and what the port owns (the T3 form, the forks, and the port-only files). Defined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); enforced by `tools/sync.mjs`, which fails on an undeclared fork, a denylist term, and a rule that no longer matches upstream.
- **Upstream pin** - the per-component upstream SHA in `tools/upstream.json`. `sync.mjs` advances it only when a sync completes without a failure. A text conflict does not hold it back: the conflict is written with git's markers, which the generator rejects.
- **Generator** - `tools/generate.mjs`. Stamps facts from their single source into every committed copy and validates cross-file contracts. CI runs it with `--check` and fails on any stale copy.
- **VERSION** - the repo-root file holding the plugin version. Releases edit it, add the matching `CHANGES.md` heading, and regenerate; plugin auto-update installs by this number.
