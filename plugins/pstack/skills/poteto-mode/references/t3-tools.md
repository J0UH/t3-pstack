# T3 tool mapping for pstack

t3-pstack runs inside T3 Code, on a Claude Code or a Codex thread. Every subagent, panel, fan-out, schedule, and PR watch goes through the `t3-code` MCP tools, so a panel can mix Claude, GPT, and Grok children. Read this before following a skill that dispatches work, names a model, schedules, watches a PR, or proves UI behavior.

## Precedence

This file wins for dispatch, models, schedules, pull requests, transcripts, and UI evidence, including over poteto-mode's Platform Adaptation section and each skill's Models and Reasoning effort sections. Everything else follows the host. On Claude Code the skills' tool names work as written. On a Codex host, read [codex-tools.md](codex-tools.md) for everything else, such as files, shell, web search, skills, the todolist, `AskUserQuestion`, and the `run` driver. Its dispatch and model rows, and its per-skill notes on dispatch, do not apply.

Hosts prefix MCP tool names, as in `mcp__t3-code__delegate_task` or `mcp__t3_code__delegate_task`. This file uses the bare names.

This plugin is `t3-pstack`, so its skills and agents register as `t3-pstack:<name>`. The skills keep upstream's `pstack:<name>` spelling. Read every `pstack:<name>` in them as `t3-pstack:<name>`, and never invoke a `pstack:` skill or agent, because that namespace belongs to the separate pstack-claude plugin.

## Tool actions

| pstack / Claude action | On T3 |
|------------------------|-------|
| Dispatch a subagent (the `Agent` tool) | `delegate_task` with `mode: "async"`, the role's target from [the sheet](#the-sheet), and a `role` (`implementation`, `research`, `review`, `design`, `test`, or `general`). Keep the returned `taskId`. |
| Dispatch N parallel subagents | N `delegate_task` calls in one response. |
| Wait for a subagent result | The child's completion wakes this thread, so end the turn instead of polling. Call `task_status` only when a result is needed mid-turn. Reading a terminal result acknowledges its delivery. |
| Continue a subagent, or the next review round (`SendMessage`) | A new `delegate_task` with the consolidated scope: the original brief, every later directive, the prior report, and unresolved objections. Give each round its own `clientRequestId`, stable across retries of that round. Never `t3_thread_send` to a `childThreadId`. |
| Stop a subagent | `task_cancel`, then confirm with `task_status`. |
| List subagents | `t3_thread_list` with `includeSubagents: true`. |
| Read what a child did | `t3_thread_read` on its `childThreadId`. Its provider, model, and transcript are the evidence of which family ran. |
| Schedule a self-paced re-invocation (`ScheduleWakeup`, `/loop`) | `schedule_task` with a structured `schedule`, bound to this thread, and a `title` that names the loop. `delete_scheduled_task` when the loop ends. The project holds other scheduled tasks, so find yours in `list_scheduled_tasks` by its title and this thread's `boundThreadId`, and never delete one that does not match both. Report the returned cadence and `nextRunAt`. |
| Recurring automation | `schedule_task` with `bindToCurrentThread: false`, so each run gets a fresh thread. `list_scheduled_tasks`, `update_scheduled_task` (`enabled: false` pauses), `delete_scheduled_task`. `run_scheduled_task_now` triggers one run to prove the schedule works. |
| Watch a PR until something changes | `watch_pull_request`, then end the turn. T3 wakes the thread on a failed check, passing required checks (all checks when none are required), a new comment or review from another account, a conflict, or a close. The watch survives pushes and ends on merge without a wake. `unwatch_pull_request` stops it. Only a top-level thread can watch. A `delegate_task` child that opens a PR returns its URL so the parent links and watches it, and waits on CI only when its own work needs the result, by looping `watch-pr --pr <n> --timeout 540` like Babysit `drive`, never with an unbounded `gh pr checks --watch`. |
| Open a PR | After `gh pr create`, call `link_pull_request` with its URL. For a stack, link every layer. Before finishing, `list_thread_pull_requests` returns the linked PRs bottom to top; link any that is missing. `unlink_pull_request` removes one opened by mistake. |
| A separate top-level conversation | `t3_thread_launch` with an explicit `workspaceStrategy`, only where a playbook below or the user asks for one. Follow it with `t3_thread_read` and `t3_thread_wait`. |
| Find an earlier conversation | `t3_thread_search`, which covers one project, the calling thread's or the `projectId` you pass. When the work spans projects, search once per project from `t3_project_list`. Read with `t3_thread_read` bounded by `maxCharsPerItem`, page with `afterPosition`, and expand one item with `itemId` and `textOffset` only when it matters. |
| Queued input on a thread | `t3_queue_list`, `t3_queue_read`, `t3_queue_edit`, `t3_queue_reorder`, `t3_queue_cancel`, `t3_queue_promote_to_steer`. |
| A question another thread is waiting on | `t3_pending_request_list`, `t3_pending_request_read`, `t3_pending_request_respond`. Approvals are not included. |

## Subagent policy

poteto-mode's [Subagents](../SKILL.md#subagents) section applies through `delegate_task`, with these mappings:

- Every pstack role dispatches through `delegate_task`, same family included, so every child shows up in T3 and reads its options from one place.
- A child gets only its brief, never the parent's context. Pass file pointers and absolute paths.
- `subagent_type: "pstack:poteto-agent"` becomes a brief that opens with "Read `<plugin>/skills/poteto-mode/SKILL.md` in full before any work." Use the absolute path you read this file from. `pstack:comment-sicko` becomes the same with `<plugin>/skills/poteto-mode/references/agents/comment-sicko.md`. Any other `subagent_type`, and the effort agents, need no brief line.
- `readonly: true` becomes a sentence in the brief: inspect only, `git diff` is fine, change no file.
- `isolation: "worktree"` becomes a worktree you create first with `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<slug> -b <branch>` from `HEAD`, so a delegate on a feature branch builds on its commits. The brief names it by absolute path as the only place the child writes. `delegate_task` has no workspace of its own, so the child starts in your checkout. The brief tells it to run every command with that path as its working directory (`workdir` on Codex) and to edit by absolute path. Record `git status --porcelain` in your checkout before you dispatch. After you take the result, check that it is unchanged, then remove the worktree and delete its branch.
- A step a playbook or skill says to delegate goes to `delegate_task` on that role's sheet entry, not into your own tool calls. Doing one yourself needs a stated reason, such as a step too small to brief.
- A research delegate that no role names, such as an inventory, a web lookup, a transcript read, or extraction from a video or a document, runs on the `how explorer` entry.
- End every poteto-mode reply that ran a playbook with a dispatch ledger: one line per delegated step, naming the role and the `providerInstanceId/model` it ran on, or `in-thread: <reason>`. A playbook run with no dispatches says so in one line.
- A role value's effort lives in its sheet entry. Ignore the `@<level>` syntax and the Reasoning effort section in the skills.
- A rejected target runs on another target of the same family from `orchestrator_capabilities`, and you say so. The skills' own fallback rules name Claude aliases and do not apply. When the catalog has no other target of that family, the seat stays empty. A required review with no reviewer from another family stays `BLOCKED: independent review`, per poteto-mode.

## The sheet

The override sheet is `t3-pstack-models.md` in the host's config directory, which is `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.claude` on Claude Code, `$CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex` on Codex. Its name differs from pstack-claude's `pstack-models.md`, so the two plugins never read each other's sheet, and every `pstack-models.md` path in setup-pstack means this file. Read it before the first dispatch in a session, on either host. It needs no include line and no paste into `AGENTS.md`.

Each role line holds one entry. A panel role (`arena runners`, `arena cross-judge pool`, `architect runners`, `interrogate reviewers`) holds a comma-separated list. An entry is `<providerInstanceId>/<modelId>` followed by any `<optionId>=<value>` pairs, or `inherit-parent` (alias `auto`). It maps one to one onto `delegate_task`'s `target`. The provider instance becomes `providerInstanceId`, the model becomes `model`, and the pairs become `options`. `inherit-parent` omits `target`. It does not count toward a panel's two families, because one sheet serves every thread on the machine. Option IDs differ per provider (Claude names the reasoning option `effort`, Codex and Grok name it `reasoningEffort`), so copy them from `orchestrator_capabilities`, never from another provider's line.

A model's family is the first segment of its ID, such as `claude`, `gpt`, or `grok`, whatever provider instance serves it. "A different model family" and panel diversity mean different families, not different providers. Your own family is the one in `orchestrator_capabilities`' `inheritedModel`.

`session hook: on` or `off` keeps its usual meaning. A T3 sheet has no `default effort` line, and the checker rejects one. An entry without options runs at the provider's default.

## Model names

On T3 the sheet names T3 targets, not the Claude aliases in each skill's Models section. Resolve every role from the sheet (see [The sheet](#the-sheet)). A role with no line runs on its tier's default below, and the aliases in the skills' Models sections do not apply. The defaults, as a complete sheet:

## UI evidence

Prove UI behavior on the real surface and put the proof in the thread.

- **The project's verify skill comes first** (`.claude/skills/verify/`, or the repo's own driver skill). It is the only path for surfaces T3's browser cannot drive: Electron and desktop apps, Obsidian, CLIs, and TUIs.
- **Web apps** use the `preview_*` tools. `preview_open`, then `preview_navigate` with `{target: {kind: "environment-port", port}}` for a dev server, or `url`. `preview_snapshot` before acting, then act with `locator: "aria-ref=<ref>"` from the latest snapshot, or a role or text locator: `preview_click`, `preview_type`, `preview_press`, `preview_scroll`, `preview_hover`, `preview_select`, `preview_drag`, `preview_upload`, and `preview_wait_for`. `preview_dialog` answers a dialog that `preview_status` reports. Refs expire on navigation and on the next snapshot. `preview_resize` and `preview_set_appearance` cover breakpoints and dark mode. `preview_evaluate` reads page state.
- **Web evidence** is `preview_snapshot` with `save: true`, embedded in the reply as a Markdown image whose target is the returned `screenshotPath`, and a `preview_recording_start` / `preview_recording_stop` pair around an interaction, linked by the path the stop returns. `t3_preview_list` and `t3_preview_close` clean up tabs.
- **iOS Simulator and Android Emulator** use the `device_*` tools. `device_list`, then `device_open`, which boots the device, shows it in the user's Device panel, and returns the `agent-device` CLI invocation that drives it. `device_screenshot` captures what the user sees. `device_close` with `shutdown: true` powers off a device you booted.

The evidence is the artifact these tools return, never your description of it. A live verifier lane that a child runs opens its own tab with `preview_open`, `reuseExistingTab: false`, and `open: false` unless the user should watch, and passes the returned `tabId` on every call.

## Playbooks

- **Babysit.** *The watch* is T3's `watch_pull_request`. *The watcher* is the bare `watch-pr`, which gives every verdict. The watch wakes the thread only on a failed check, passing required checks, a new comment or review from another account, a conflict, or a close, so babysitting uses it only to wait for a human review. Every other wait loops the watcher inside the turn, in place of playbook step 6's `/loop`. A user Stop interrupts that turn, and nothing outlives it. Where playbook step 6 says to rearm the watcher, run it again in the same turn. `watch-pr` holds READY until review activity settles (`--settle`, default 300s; an `eyes` reaction holds it up to 30 minutes after the latest push, opening, or ready for review), so no per-bot rules are needed.
  - **`drive`.** All in one turn:
    - **a.** Handle the review threads already on the PR, because the watch wakes only on comments posted after it is armed.
    - **b.** Run the watcher: `watch-pr --pr <n> --timeout 540`, or `watch-pr --stack --pr <lowest open PR> --timeout 540` for a stack, with the shell's own timeout above 540 seconds and under the 600-second tool cap.
    - **c.** Act on the verdict:
      - `READY`: done, per playbook steps 6 and 9. In a stack, a `READY` that covers only merged PRs while open layers remain is not done, because the watcher sees only its seed once that PR merges. Seed it again with the lowest open PR and go to b. A `ci-none` `READY` in a repository with files in `.github/workflows` is final only once two consecutive runs on the same head report it, because checks can register after the watcher's 60-second confirm. Until then, go to b.
      - `BLOCKER` on a conflict, the `behind-base` gate, failing checks, or review threads: work it per playbook step 5.
      - The `review-required` gate, or `changes-requested` once its threads are handled: if the thread is settled, unsettle it with `t3_thread_organize` first, because a settled thread ends its watches. Then arm the watch on that PR, and on every other unmerged layer of a stack, if it is not armed, and end the turn. Another account's review wakes the thread, and the drive starts again at a. A merge of a watched PR ends the watch without a wake, so the hand-off says that a merge ends the wait and the user messages the thread after one. This human-review wait is exempt from the caps in d on purpose: the thread is idle and costs nothing until a person acts.
      - `draft-pr`, `closed-without-merge`, `merge-blocked`, or a `status-query` exit 7 whose `failure.retryable` is false: report the gate or `failure.detail`, and stop.
      - Every `TIMEOUT`: go to b. A `status-query` exit 7 whose `failure.retryable` is true: wait 60 seconds, the watcher's own first backoff, then go to b, because a failed `--stack` discovery returns at once.
    - **d.** Report the verdict and stop when its key has not changed for two hours of wall clock, or when the drive has run three hours in total. The key is the frontier's head SHA (`gh pr view <n> --json headRefOid`), the verdict kind, and its reason or blocker kind. `observedAt` and `sequence` are not part of it.
    - **e.** *Stop* means `unwatch_pull_request` if the watch is armed, then hand back.
  - **`background`.** Arm the watch and keep working on the plan. A wake arrives as a queued message. At each natural pause, take the verdict with `watch-pr --pr <n> --timeout 180`, which fits two reads and the 60-second interval between them with slack. Act on a `READY` or a `BLOCKER` as in `drive`, and on a `TIMEOUT` keep working. If the plan finishes with the PR still waiting, switch to `drive`.
  - **`check`.** One `watch-pr --pr <n> --status-only --timeout 120 --max-query-errors 2`, which prints one table, per playbook step 6. No watch. A head with no checks yet, in a repository where an earlier commit reported some, is a retryable read failure, and the default budget of five errors backs off for 12 minutes, past the tool cap. `--max-query-errors 2` ends it after one retry. A `checks-unavailable` failure or a `ci-unreported` row means no checks have reported on this head yet, so report that, not "no CI".
  - T3 ignores comments from the GitHub account it reads with, so an operator who reviews under that account messages the thread afterward.
- **Autopilot-full, autopilot-stack, orchestrate.** Invoking one of these is the request for top-level threads. Each PR owner is a `t3_thread_launch` with `workspaceStrategy: {type: "worktree", baseRef, branch, startFromOrigin: false}`, briefed with the playbook steps and this thread's ID so it reports back with `t3_thread_send`. Verifier lanes are `delegate_task` children assigned round-robin over the `interrogate reviewers` entries, so lanes span families. The hourly audit tick is a `schedule_task` bound to this thread. Watch each owner's PR with `watch_pull_request`.
- **Worktree and simulator cleanup.** A worktree is in use when a T3 thread is bound to it, whatever the transcript audit says. `t3_thread_list` does not return `worktreePath`, so page through `t3_thread_list` with `includeSubagents: true` and `t3_thread_read` each thread for its `worktreePath`.
- **Bug fix, Feature, Refactoring.** Before Opening a PR, run **interrogate** on the diff with the `interrogate reviewers` panel and settle its blocking findings through the review loop below. Skip it only for a mechanical change, such as a rename or a dependency bump, and say so in the reply.
- **Review loop.** Every implement, review, and fix cycle runs this way.
  - **Severity gate.** Only findings the lead puts under interrogate's Act on block, including `warning` correctness findings. A nit, or an edge case that cannot occur in practice, never blocks. Batch accepted nits into one final `feature, refactoring` run at the end, or drop them. Each dismissal states its reason, as interrogate's Dismissed bucket asks.
  - **Later rounds review the fix diff.** Round 1 runs the `interrogate reviewers` panel on the whole change. Each later round runs the same panel on the fix diff only.
  - **Verify each fix.** After every fix round, a `feature, refactoring` entry runs the real artifact through the project's verify skill or the change's real surface (see [UI evidence](#ui-evidence)) and reports `pass`, `fail`, or `could not run`, with the evidence. `fail` blocks like an Act on finding. `could not run` is not a pass and starts no fix: report it to the user.
  - **Fix-round cap.** At most three fix rounds, whatever starts them. Then stop and report the open findings, what kind of failure they suggest, and a recommendation. The user decides whether to continue.
- **Opening a PR, Shipping.** `link_pull_request` per PR as it opens, always with its URL. Read a stack bottom to top from `list_thread_pull_requests`. Shipping step 9 loops `watch-pr --queued-stack --stack-prs <bottom> --timeout 540` inside the shipping turn, in place of its `/loop`, with the shell's own timeout above 540 seconds and under the 600-second tool cap. Each `TIMEOUT` is a wakeup for the step's `ship-pr inspect` comparison, and then the watcher runs again in the same turn. The loop ends at the playbook's terminal outcome: `COMPLETE`, a blocker, or a human gate it says to hand back on. When it has run three hours in total, report the verdict and stop. The one exception to the watch ban is a `review-required` or `changes-requested` gate, which a rebase can raise by dismissing an approval: unsettle the thread if it is settled, arm the watch on that PR, and end the turn; on the wake, re-verify the head per step 6 before any merge. Otherwise never substitute `watch_pull_request` there: it does not wake on a merge, on `behind-base`, or on merge-queue state.

## Per-skill notes

Every skill below carries a pointer to this file under its heading. Read its row before you follow it.

| Skill | On T3 |
|-------|-------|
| `poteto-mode` | Subagents map through Subagent policy above, and the playbooks named in [Playbooks](#playbooks) change as listed there. Proof on a UI surface follows [UI evidence](#ui-evidence). |
| `setup-pstack` | The T3 sheet replaces steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Detect models with `orchestrator_capabilities`, not the `Agent` tool. Start from the current sheet, or from the defaults in [Model names](#model-names) when there is none. Drop any value that is not a T3 entry (a bare family name, a `claude-` ID, `@<level>`) and the `default effort` line. Offer each role the catalog's targets and that provider's own option values in the grammar of [The sheet](#the-sheet); panel roles need at least two families among their targets. A role with no line runs on its tier default, which the checker also checks, so add a line for any role whose default this machine cannot run. Ask the `session hook` question as written. Write the candidate to a temp file. Then call `orchestrator_capabilities` again and save its result to a temp file as `{"providers": [...]}`, copying verbatim the entry of every provider instance the candidate or the defaults name. Run `node <plugin>/skills/setup-pstack/scripts/t3-sheet.mjs <candidate> <catalog.json>`, and fix every line it prints before you touch the real sheet. Then overwrite the sheet, writing through any symlink at its path (resolve it with `realpath`). It needs no include line. One sheet serves both hosts, so link the other host's sheet path to it (`ln -s`). If a different file is already there, run the checker on it and ask before you replace it. On Codex, remove any pstack model rows an earlier setup pasted into `<codex-home>/AGENTS.md`. The sheet may live in a dotfiles repo with both host paths linked to it, one sheet per machine when the machines' provider instances differ. |
| `automate-me` | The parallel history readers are `delegate_task` calls. Find and read the transcripts per Find an earlier conversation in [Tool actions](#tool-actions), with `t3_thread_list` for recent threads, not from `~/.claude/projects/`. |
| `arena` | Each runner is one `delegate_task` on an `arena runners` entry. A runner that writes code gets its own worktree (Subagent policy). The cross-judge is an `arena cross-judge pool` entry whose model ran no candidate, so no model scores its own work. Among those, prefer one whose family differs from yours. If every pool entry ran a candidate, say so in the reply and judge on the entry that wrote the fewest. |
| `architect` | The runner panel goes through the **arena** skill, so its dispatch applies, on the `architect runners` entries. |
| `interrogate` | One `delegate_task` per `interrogate reviewers` entry, with `role: "review"` and the read-only sentence. Each later round is a fresh `delegate_task`, with the prior findings and a new `clientRequestId`, and follows the review loop in [Playbooks](#playbooks). Name each reviewer's family in the merged verdict. |
| `swarm` | Each worker is a `delegate_task` on the `swarm workers` entry, or on each arm's entry in a race. Writers get worktrees (Subagent policy). |
| `show-me-your-work` | The handback reviewer is a `delegate_task` on a family other than the one that did the work. Each decision row that delegated work names the child's provider, model, and `taskId`. Check the log against `t3_thread_read` of this thread and its children. |
| `how` | Explorers and the explainer are `delegate_task` calls with the read-only sentence. |
| `why` | Investigators and the synthesizer are `delegate_task` calls. Dispatch the synthesizer after every investigator's completion has arrived. |
| `reflect` | The three reviewers and the synthesizer are `delegate_task` calls. Find and read the transcript per Find an earlier conversation in [Tool actions](#tool-actions). |
| `recall` | Search and read threads per Find an earlier conversation in [Tool actions](#tool-actions), with `t3_thread_list` for recent threads, child threads included. |
| `ketchup` | Read the state of delegated children with `task_status` and of this thread's pull requests with `list_thread_pull_requests`. When the `html_render` tool is available, show the before-and-after visuals as one HTML page through it, checked first with `html_preview`, and keep the reply to what the page does not say. Screenshots and recordings follow [UI evidence](#ui-evidence). |
| `teach` | Running `how` and `why` in parallel is two `delegate_task` calls. Show running behavior through [UI evidence](#ui-evidence). |
| `no-comments` | `pstack:comment-sicko` is a `delegate_task` whose brief reads its agent file first (Subagent policy). Pass it the scope, and do not give it a worktree, because a worktree lacks the scope's uncommitted changes. |
| `create-verification-skill` | For a web app the generated skill drives through the `preview_*` tools, and for a simulator through the `device_*` tools (see [UI evidence](#ui-evidence)). Every other surface keeps its own harness. |
| `maintain-verification-skill` | Per-feature source readers are `delegate_task` calls. The live pass drives through the project's verify skill or [UI evidence](#ui-evidence). To run it on a schedule, `schedule_task` with `{type: "fixed_time", timeOfDay, weekdays}`, the repo's `projectId`, `bindToCurrentThread: false`, and a prompt that runs `/t3-pstack:maintain-verification-skill`. Prove it once with `run_scheduled_task_now`. |
| `babysit` | On T3 this skill's own polling (`gh pr checks --watch`, the `loop` skill) is replaced entirely by the Babysit mapping in [Playbooks](#playbooks). The watcher (the bare `watch-pr`) gives every verdict and loops inside the turn in place of playbook step 6's `/loop` and polling. The watch (`watch_pull_request`) only waits for a human review. Per mode, see [Playbooks](#playbooks). |
| `poteto-help` | The user types it as `/t3-pstack:poteto-help`. Every slash command it hands the user is `/t3-pstack:<name>`, whatever the linked reference spells. Its model and routing check and its missing-sheet question read the T3 sheet, `t3-pstack-models.md` (see [The sheet](#the-sheet)), not the `pstack-models.md` that setup-pstack's Other runtimes table names, and the question offers a model per role without a default effort, because a T3 sheet sets effort in each entry. Setup is `/t3-pstack:setup-pstack`. Install commands come from t3-pstack's README (`chhoumann/t3-pstack`), not pstack-claude's, and public copies link under `https://github.com/chhoumann/t3-pstack/blob/main/plugins/pstack/`. |
