# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in the model sheet. If the sheet or that line is missing, use the default in [Models](#models). For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit `target` so the workers run on the parent model. If `delegate_task` rejects an entry, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use another target of the same family from `orchestrator_capabilities`. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one response as `delegate_task` calls with `mode: "async"` and the step 3 `target`, left unset for `auto` or `inherit-parent`. Every worker runs on this machine, so a worker that writes gets its own git worktree, named by absolute path in its brief as the only place it writes.

When a worker must start from a non-default branch, create its worktree from that branch.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.

## Models

Role defaults on T3, stamped from `plugins/pstack/models.json`. A role line in the model sheet overrides each one. The sheet is `~/.config/t3-pstack/models.md` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/t3-pstack/models.md` when that is set), one per machine, and `/setup-pstack` writes it. When it is missing, read `t3-pstack-models.md` in the host's config directory (`$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.claude` on Claude Code, `$CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex` on Codex). An entry is `<providerInstanceId>/<modelId>` plus `<optionId>=<value>` pairs, and it maps onto `delegate_task`'s `target`, with the provider instance as `providerInstanceId`, the model as `model`, and the pairs as `options`. It splits at its first `/`, so a model ID with its own `/`, such as OpenCode's `<provider>/<model>`, is written whole after it. Option IDs differ per provider, so take them from `orchestrator_capabilities`. `inherit-parent` or `auto` omits `target`.
