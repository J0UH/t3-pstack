# t3-pstack

pstack for [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code). It is Lauren Tan's (poteto's) [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack), with its Cursor mechanics rewritten in place for T3. Every subagent, panel, fan-out, schedule, and PR watch dispatches through T3's `t3-code` MCP tools, so an `interrogate`, `arena`, or `architect` panel can run Claude, GPT, and Grok reviewers side by side, from a Claude Code thread or a Codex thread.

The skill text is Lauren's. A generated set of substitutions rewrites only what names Cursor (its `Task` tool, its model slugs, its `.mdc` rule, its cloud agents, `/loop`), and a few declared forks carry what a substitution cannot. Nothing else needs loading: the T3 rules sit where Lauren's dispatch rules sit.

t3-pstack works only inside T3.

## Install, update, and check

```shell
npx -y github:chhoumann/t3-pstack install
npx -y github:chhoumann/t3-pstack update
npx -y github:chhoumann/t3-pstack doctor
```

`npx -y github:chhoumann/t3-pstack` runs the installer from the latest commit on `main`. That is the rolling channel, the same one each home's marketplace auto-updates from. To run one release's installer, name its tag, as in `npx -y github:chhoumann/t3-pstack#v2.0.0-rc.6 doctor`.

`install` and `update` are the same command, and a second run changes nothing. With Node 20 or later, it installs or updates the `t3-pstack@t3-pstack` plugin in every Claude Code and Codex config home T3 can run: `~/.claude` and `~/.codex`, `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `$CODEX_HOME`, and the home of each `claudeAgent` and `codex` instance in T3's settings, disabled ones included. Name any other home with `--claude-home <dir>` or `--codex-home <dir>`. Each home's `t3-pstack` marketplace must come from `chhoumann/t3-pstack`, or from `--source <owner/repo|git URL|dir>` on the same run, and a home whose marketplace has another source is left as it is. A local directory needs a path such as `./t3-pstack`, since `owner/repo` always means GitHub. On Codex it also trusts t3-pstack's session-start hook, once its hooks file is the one this release pins. Codex runs a plugin's hook only once it is trusted, and T3's Codex sessions never ask, so without this step the hook never runs. Run `update` after each release.

`doctor` reports on the same homes and changes nothing itself: each marketplace's source, the installed version, whether its files are all there, whether it is enabled, the Codex hook's trust, Claude Code records that pin an old version, plain copies of the plugin's skills, and the model sheet. It exits 1 on any problem and prints a fix for each.

Then run `/t3-pstack:setup-pstack` in a T3 thread on each machine. It writes the model sheet, `~/.config/t3-pstack/models.md`, with one T3 target per role (`<providerInstanceId>/<modelId>` plus that provider's options), and checks it against the machine's `orchestrator_capabilities`. Without a sheet, every role runs on the defaults in its skill's Models section.

## Use

```text
Use poteto-mode to fix the search filter resetting when I change pages.
```

The session-start hook tells each new chat when to enter `poteto-mode` on its own: work that touches more than one file, a design choice, or a bug whose cause is unknown. `poteto-mode` matches the task to a playbook and opens the other skills from there. They ship as upstream ships them, invoked by `poteto-mode` or typed by you (`/t3-pstack:<name>` on Claude Code, `$t3-pstack:<name>` on Codex).

The plugin carries 62 skill directories, 24 of them `principle-*` leaves, and 4 agents.

## Staying current

This repository syncs from Lauren's tree directly, synced against upstream `99743e9`. `tools/upstream.json` pins each component, `tools/substitutions.json` holds the rewrite rules and a denylist of Cursor terms, and `tools/forks.json` declares every file the port keeps in its own form and why. `bun tools/sync.mjs <component> <sha>` derives each upstream file through the rules, merges it three ways with the port's copy, and fails on an undeclared fork, a denylist hit, or a rule that no longer matches upstream. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#the-sync-boundary) has the details.

## Data handling

t3-pstack has no server or telemetry. Anything its skills ask your agent to read, including session transcripts, goes to your model provider. Scripts run locally, and PR tools use your GitHub CLI login.

## Contributing

Bug reports, documentation fixes, and T3 improvements are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the checks and where your change belongs. Report vulnerabilities privately as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
